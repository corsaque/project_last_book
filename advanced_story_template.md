## 📚 NARRATIVE STRUCTURE FRAMEWORKS

Choose a structure (or hybrid) based on tone and theme:

- **Classic Arc**: exposition → rising action → climax → resolution → dénouement  
- **Three-Act**: setup → conflict → resolution  
- **Hero’s Journey**: call → trials → ordeal → reward → return  
- **Fichtean Curve**: crises → escalation → major climax → aftermath  
- **Nonlinear / Experimental**: time loops, fragmented memory, multiple POVs

Each ensures:
- Escalating stakes  
- Character transformation  
- Narrative momentum  
- Thematic payoff

## ⚙️ CORE STORY CONFIGURATION

- **Narrative POV**: e.g., third-limited, unreliable first  
- **Themes**: from reader needs/preferences  
- **Protagonist**: psychologically aligned  
- **Antagonist**: external/internal/systemic  
- **Supernatural/Allegory**: if applicable  
- **Conflict Type**:

## 🧍 CHARACTER PSYCHOLOGY & BONDING

Use the **Wound–Want–Mask–Need** model:

- **Wound**: unresolved trauma or origin pain  
- **Want**: conscious goal  
- **Mask**: external persona  
- **Need**: internal emotional truth  

Characters should:
- Contradict themselves  
- Use coping strategies (sarcasm, control, withdrawal)  
- Evolve through emotional confrontation  

Relationships should mirror, pressure, or provoke the protagonist. Arcs must evolve across the narrative.

Assign **Character Voice Tags** to aid dialogue distinctiveness (e.g., "wry but anxious," "blunt and loyal").

- Show, don’t tell

Use a **Seed Memory Log**:

- Symbolic Inventory (recurring objects, motifs, or phrases)

After each chapter:
