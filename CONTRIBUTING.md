# ü§ù Contributing to Advanced Personalized Fiction Engine

Thanks for your interest in contributing! This project explores the frontier of personalized, AI-driven storytelling ‚Äî where every story is co-authored by the reader.

## üß≠ What This Project Is

A structured, extensible prompt system for generating adaptive, reader-tailored fiction using large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT. The goal is to flip traditional publishing on its head: instead of one book for many readers, this is one evolving book for each reader.
